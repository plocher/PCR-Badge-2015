## PCR Club Car Convention 2015
### ‘Duino Demo Board


Once a year, the model railroaders in Northern California and Nevada (officially, the [Pacific Coast Region](http://www.pcrnmra.org)
of the [National Model Railroad Association](http://nmra.org)) host a convention.
2015's theme was [The Club Car](http://http://www.pcrnmra.org/conv2015/) - a nod towards the many vibrant railroad clubs in the area. 
 

Coincidentally, the convention overlapped the Bay Area Maker Faire's time slot, which made for some very long days indeed!


Because of the juxtaposition with the Faire, [railnerd](http://railnerd.blogspot.com/) and I decided to produce an <i>assemble it yourself</i>
"badge" for the railroad convention - after all, model train buffs
are all makers of one sort or another - and getting into animations
and layout control with a 'duino is a natural progression from
controlling trains with a packet network on the rails (via [Digital
Command Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control))...


With judicious ebay and alibaba sleuthing, along with raiding some old stockpiles and a run to
a local surplus store, we managed to produce a 30-board run with a total per-board BOM cost of about $20!
(ICStation had 1602 LCDs for ~$3.10/ea, czb6721960@ebay had Pro Mini atmega328 5V 16M's for $2.50, etc...)


The PCR demo/badge board is a foundation for experimentation and learning about ‘duino programming and model railroad applications. 

 
It includes
  * An Arduino-compatible “DFR-pro-mini” clone module
  * A regulated 5v power supply
  * 9v battery (good for 6-8 hours runtime…) and adapter
  * 3x pushbuttons
  * 5x LEDs, arranged as a grade crossing and a signal head
  * A servo, and
  * A 2x16 LCD display
  * I2C connector for access to expanded IO devices
